# Fu-JS
This tool aims at accumulating javascript files from a given set of subdomains to discover hidden endpoints. It swims through JS files to find more JS files. It also creates a target-specific wordlist from the JS-files for further content discovery and dumps all the discovered JS files neatly in a folder for static analysis.
